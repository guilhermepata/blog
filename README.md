# About

Welcome to my [place on the web](guilhermepata.github.io). I am a biomedical engineering student and aspiring neuroscientist. Here you can find my [essays](guilhermepata.github.io/essays) and my other little [projects](guilhermepata.github.io/projects). You can check out my [Medium](guilhermepata.medium.com) page too, where I also publish my essays. The code for this project is freely available here, on this GitHub repository.
