# About

Welcome to [my place](https://guilhermepata.github.io) on the web. I am a biomedical engineering student and aspiring neuroscientist. Here you can find my [essays](https://guilhermepata.github.io/essays) and my other little [projects](https://guilhermepata.github.io/projects). You can check out my [Medium](https://guilhermepata.medium.com) page too, where I also publish my essays. The code for this project is freely available here, on this GitHub repository.
