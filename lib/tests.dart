String string = "On The Rights Of Brains - Organic Or Otherwise\n===\nWhy Neuroethics Matters To Artificial Intelligence\n---\n\nIn 1950, Alan Turing devised a test to determine whether a machine has human-like intelligence, which he dubbed the 'imitation game': a human tester is tasked with determining which one of two different 'players' is human and which is a computer, using only written responses to written questions. [1] Today, intelligent machines like GPT-3 - which can have text conversations, write articles, and even develop functioning computer code - show that we are getting eerily close to developing machines that can pass the Turing test. [2] While in the short term we may disregard fears of a singularity - the creation of an artificial superintelligent agent - these developments should lead us to reconsider the moral standing of virtual minds. Moreover, they should remind us that when it comes to caring for other minds, humanity's track record falls short.\n\n![HAL9000](https://miro.medium.com/max/3600/1*hRRLnrJODSlC2Er2AhIqNg.jpeg)\n\nThe question of whether or not a machine that passed the Turing test would be able to think, or even if it would be sentient, is still the subject of heated debate. Turing himself believed that such a distinction was meaningless, on the grounds that we do not have a clear definition for 'thinking'. The linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky agrees that the question is ill-posed, seeing it only as a semantic discussion. From his perspective, since humans and computers are inescapably different, a computer can 'think' (like a human) insofar as a submarine can 'swim' (like a fish), or an airplane can 'fly' (like a bird). [3] On the other hand, functionalists like the philosopher of mind Daniel Dennet hold a very different view. If a machine passes the Turing test, then, he would claim, we have no experimental evidence that can distinguish it from a human mind. Therefore, we must conclude that whatever 'goings-on' there may be in the machine's 'mind' will be so analogous to human thinking that we have to afford it the capacity for thought. Dennet goes on to defend that any being indistinguishable from a human in all regards must be sentient. [4] Hence, he denies the possibility of 'philosophical zombies' - or, if we are being brazen, he views all humans as such.";
